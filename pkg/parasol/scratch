Need a big title
Attribute your fisrst graph
lhs table figure, what the heck is it for
workflow is a crud title
not really clear when your model cuts in on the performance chart
models separate class groups, results separate classes alone, how do these jive

me: 
restyle slider,
handle out-of-bounds errors, and expand domain
show full screen
limit parameter to avoid crazy results
make cost slide as backup, practice details, emphasize that you can get the shortest path
