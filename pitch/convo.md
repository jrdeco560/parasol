# Rationale-in-Progress for **XXX** Project

## **Co**ntext

*Who are the people with an interest in the results of this project? What are
they generally trying to achieve? What work, generally, is the project going to
be furthering?*

## **N**eed

*What are the specific needs that could be fixed by intelligently using the
data? These needs should be presetned in terms that are meaningful to the
organization. If our method will be to build a model, the need is not to build
a model. The need is to solve the porblem that having a model will solve.*

## **V**ision

*The vision is a glimpse of what it will look like to meet the need with data.
It could consist of a mockup describing the intended results, or a sketch of
the argument that we're going to make, or some particular questions that
narrowly focus our aims.*

## **O**utcome

*We need to understand how the work will actually make it back to the rest of
the orgainization and what will happen once it is there. How will it be userd?
How will it be integrated into the organization? Who will own its integration?
Who will use it? In the end, how will it success be measured?*
