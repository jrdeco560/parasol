# Exploratory Data Analysis

+ For the study area, I'd like a manageable dataset that includes urban and
  suburban areas. I used the MA LiDAR index shapefile and a town boundary
  shapefile to figure out which LiDAR dataset to get. If my study area is Boston,
  Cambridge, Somerville, Brookline, Arlington, Belmont, Newton, then the "Sandy"
  LiDAR survey is sufficient.
